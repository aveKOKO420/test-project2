The website should operate normally as long as all the files are placed in
the same folder, though that folder must be placed in the path
*Path to xampp*/htdocs/*folder with website*.

Next xampp must be running and Apache and MySQL must be turned on.

After that in phpMyAdmin, the sql code found in usersDB is executed
to create the database, used by the website.

That should be all the setup needed. The registration page is index.php
